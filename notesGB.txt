+ Speed up the algorithm
  - implement over-relaxed version with theta = 1.8.
  - DNO update
    (i)   solve the system of equation via backlash A\b
    (ii)  change the algorithm to alternated projection (double check if that is possible)
    (iii) try some built-in solvers

+ simluation plan
  - the P2P baseline price plot is not too informative 

+ create a picture for the prosumers system

+ submit to arXiv
